getUrls.py - gets random public profile urls from linkedin directory. PLEASE modify as needed before use. Final output should go to profiles_urls.txt. This is NOT happening in this commit because of issues with file writing. Please change

linkedin_test.py - gets whatever API gives for standard profile of the urls got from above file. Also can get for your own profile and its connections. Writes into random_profiles.txt for all the random profiles and to profiles_api.txt for my connections

PLEASE install BeautifulSoup. Need it to run this. (pip install beautifulsoup4) everything for Python 2.7 I've done although it should run with Python3 also. Tried to maintain compatibility

PLEASE install linkedin python module from here: https://github.com/ozgur/python-linkedin 
(pip install python-linkedin)
