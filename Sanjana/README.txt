getUrls.py - gets random public profile urls from linkedin directory. PLEASE modify as needed before use. Final output should go to profiles_urls.txt. This is NOT happening in this commit because of issues with file writing. Please change

linkedin_test.py - gets whatever API gives for standard profile of the urls got from above file. Also can get for your own profile and its connections. Writes into random_profiles.txt for all the random profiles and to profiles_api.txt for my connections
